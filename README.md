Air Quality Prediction App üåç
Project Overview
The Air Quality Prediction App uses machine learning to predict the air quality based on environmental data. This app helps to assess the air quality in real-time by using various environmental parameters like PM2.5, PM10, temperature, humidity, NO2, SO2, CO, proximity to industrial areas, and population density. The app provides an intuitive user interface where users can input environmental data and receive a predicted air quality status.

The predicted air quality is mapped to the AQI (Air Quality Index) range, which helps classify the air quality as:

Good (0‚Äì50)
Moderate (51‚Äì100)
Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (101‚Äì150)
Poor (151‚Äì200)
Very Unhealthy (201‚Äì300)
Hazardous (301‚Äì500)
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Framework: LightGBM
Web Framework: Streamlit
Libraries:
Scikit-learn (for data preprocessing and scaling)
Joblib (for saving and loading models)
NumPy (for numerical operations)
Deployment: Local or cloud deployment via Streamlit sharing (optional)
Features
Real-time Prediction: Users can input environmental parameters to get an instant prediction of the air quality.

Detailed Interpretation: The app provides a detailed explanation of the predicted air quality category, helping users understand the health implications of the air quality in their area.

User-friendly Interface: The app includes an easy-to-use sidebar where users can input data like temperature, humidity, PM2.5, and more.

Probabilistic AQI Prediction: Along with the air quality prediction, the app provides the probability of different air quality levels, helping users understand the certainty of the prediction.

Visual Recommendations: Based on the prediction, users will receive recommendations to either stay indoors or go outdoors safely based on air quality.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/air-quality-prediction-app.git
cd air-quality-prediction-app
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open your browser and go to the provided local address (e.g., http://localhost:8501/).

How to Use
Launch the app using Streamlit.

Use the sidebar to enter the following environmental data:

Temperature (¬∞C)
Humidity (%)
PM2.5 (¬µg/m¬≥)
PM10 (¬µg/m¬≥)
NO2 (ppb)
SO2 (ppb)
CO (ppm)
Proximity to Industrial Areas (km)
Population Density (persons/km¬≤)
Click on the "Predict Air Quality" button to get the air quality prediction.

The app will display the predicted air quality (Good, Moderate, Poor, Hazardous) and the corresponding AQI range.

Air Quality Categories
Based on AQI, the air quality is classified into the following categories:

Good (0-50): Air quality is considered satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk.
Moderate (51-100): Air quality is acceptable; however, there may be a risk for some people who are unusually sensitive to air pollution.
Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (101-150): Members of sensitive groups may experience health effects, but the general public is less likely to be affected.
Poor (151-200): Health effects may be experienced by the general population.
Very Unhealthy (201-300): Health alert; everyone may experience more serious health effects.
Hazardous (301-500): Serious health effects may occur across the entire population.
Model
The model used in this app is trained on historical air quality data and is implemented using LightGBM, a powerful and efficient gradient boosting algorithm. The model predicts air quality based on the environmental parameters provided by the user.

The following steps were followed to build the model:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.).
Model Training: The model was trained on labeled air quality data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: LightGBM's hyperparameters were optimized to achieve the best performance.
Model Evaluation: Model performance was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Conclusion
This Air Quality Prediction App is an easy-to-use tool that helps individuals, governments, and organizations assess air quality based on environmental data. It can be useful in understanding air pollution levels and making informed decisions for better health and safety.
